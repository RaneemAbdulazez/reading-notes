# Trees

Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

# Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

Depth First
Breadth First
## Important Terms
Following are the important terms with respect to tree.

Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.


# Tree Node


```
struct node {
   int data;   
   struct node *leftChild;
   struct node *rightChild;
};
```
