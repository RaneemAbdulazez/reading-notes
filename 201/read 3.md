NOTE : When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.


### min-width, max-width ,min-height, max-height

these properties specifies the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser window is narrow/wide.

### overflow

when the content contained within a box is larger
than the box itself , it is  determined whether it's :

**-hidden**
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.

**-scroll**
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content

# Loops 

a loop is often used to loop through the items in an array thre are while and for loop .

>The key difference between
a whi 1e loop and a do whi 1e
loop is that the statements in
the code block come before the
condition. This means that those
statements are run once whether
or not the condition is met.
