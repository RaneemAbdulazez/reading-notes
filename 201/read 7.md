# Domain Modeling


Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. 


This is object-oriented programming in JavaScript at its most fundamental level.

The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
The object is stored in a variable for later use.

>Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
Good luck!

CREATING MANY OBJECTS:
CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION

Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.

# ARRAYS ARE OBJECTS

You can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures:
Arrays can store a series of objects (and remember their order).
Objects can also hold arrays (as values of their properties)
