# How js makes the web page more interactive ?

----
 Javascript is a language which used beside HTML and CSS and  makes the website more interactive by : 
 - acecess content 
 - Modify content 
 - program rules which means make the page changable for user 
 - React to events : like a button press ! 

 -----
 ## Examples : 
 - slide show 
 - Forms 
 - Filtering data 

 ----
 ## writing a script : 

 Before you wirte a script you should set a goal and lsit tasks to achive it ! 
> Define the GOAL >> Design the SCRIPT >> CODE 
>You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them , ** doing a flowchart will help you! **

## OBJECTS:
each object has its own : 
Each object can have its own:
• Properties : each one has name and vlaue .
• Events :Programmers choose which events they respond to.
• Methods: are  things people need to do with objects.

## PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT : 
HTML alone makes the user see the main things in the page even if the js and css did't load , while Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself. 
js : Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript
