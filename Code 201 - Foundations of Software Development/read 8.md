# Screen Sizes:
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide. Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixel and it has advantages and disadvantages: Advantages

pixels are accurae to control size and position
designer can control apperance and postion ith liquid layout.
controling the lengths of lines of text regardless of the size of the user's window
size off images always remain the same.
Disadvantages

ending with big gaps around the edges of pages.
user's screen's resolution is higher so page can end up with smaller text which is harder to read.
if user want to icrease the size of font it might not fit in the space.
design works best on devices that have a site or resolution similar to that of desktop or laptop computers.
The page will often take up more vertical space than a liquid layout with the same content.
Liquid Layout Design
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages. main advantages that the page expand to fill all beowser's gaps, and if user's have smaller window they don't have to contract or scroll the sides ,and the designer will have results that are tolerant and larger than the intendation. Howver this also have disadvantages, designa differ from intendation if you didn't control the width of the elements,lines of text cn be longer with user making it harder to read.
