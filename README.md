 here is three things I do to remind me of `growth mindset`: 
 
     -hangout with success people  : they absoulty have growth mindset and that's why they became success . 

     -Reminding myself always : it's normal to have obstcales , it's normal not to know everything , experience is built not over time but over the numbers of tryies you did . 

     -Feel enthusiastic about challenges
